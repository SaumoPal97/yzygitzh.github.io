My project for GSoC 2017 is [Android Sandbox Detection and Countermeasure][gsoc-project]. This post records my progress during the GSoC 2017 period.

## Community Bonding Period

1. Modified AOSP (branch `android_6.0.1-r77`) to expand trace buffer to 64MB
2. Ported strazzere's `anti-emulator` app to Android Marshmallow. [source][anti-emulator]
3. Got DenDroid, a real-world malware with anti-sandbox behavior ready for testing. [source][dendroid]
4. Modified DroidBot to support re-producible event sequences for trace comparing. [PR][droidbot-reproducible]
5. Had a look into [Mining Sandbox][mining-sandbox] and [FuzzDroid][fuzzdroid] papers. These two papers provided me with different points of view about the detection of anti-sandbox techniques applied in Android apps.
